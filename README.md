# Qt C++ Neural network with GUI
This implementation of neural network is written on C++.
It has GUI which developed with Qt framework.
This application was developed with purpose to recognition
handwritten digits which are given from
[MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset.
Backpropagation algorithm is used for learning network and gradient
descent for minimizing cost function.
